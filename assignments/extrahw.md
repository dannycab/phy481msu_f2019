#### 4. Estimating the amount of excess charge on a balloon

Developing real world estimates of certain E&M phenomenon is an important skill to develop from this course. If what we do doesn't describe reality, what's the point?! In this problem, you will develop an estimate for that amount of electrons transferred to a balloon through "static electricity."

An electric field strength of 300 kV/m can cause the molecules in the air to breakdown allowing a spark to travel through the air. You have probably rubbed a ballon through your hair and heard some crackling - that is one effect of the breakdown of the molecules in the air as a result of this high field strength due to transferred electrons.

1. Estimate the minimum amount of static charge on a balloon that could cause this sparking. In your estimation, make clear any assumptions you are making and/or quantities that you are estimating or looking up. Explain how you are making this estimate in words.
2. Using your estimate in part 1, further estimate the fraction of excess electrons on the surface of the balloon compared to the number electrons that make up the balloon. Does this estimate seem reasonable to you? Why or why not?
