For linearly magnetizable materials, the relationship between the magnetization and the H-field is,

$\mathbf{M} = \chi_m \mathbf{H}$

What do you expect the sign of $X_m$ to be for a paramagnetic/diamagnetic material?

1. para: $\chi_m<0 \;$ dia: $\chi_m>0$
2. para: $\chi_m>0 \;$ dia: $\chi_m<0$
3. Both positive
4. Both negative

Note:
Correct answer: B

### Electromagnetism is the foundational field theory of physics

Think about everything you NOW know about electromagnetism (it's a lot!).

Work with a partner to map out the electromagnetism concepts that you know and how they are related to each other.

Discuss how your understanding has changed. We will discuss together.
