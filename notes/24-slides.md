What is the dipole moment of this system?

(BTW, it is NOT overall neutral!)

1. $q\mathbf{d}$
2. $2q\mathbf{d}$
3. $\frac{3}{2}q\mathbf{d}$
4. $3q\mathbf{d}$
5. Someting else (or not defined)

1. $q\mathbf{d}$
2. $2q\mathbf{d}$
3. $\frac{3}{2}q\mathbf{d}$
4. $3q\mathbf{d}$
5. Someting else (or not defined)

You have a physical dipole, $+q$ and $-q$ a finite distance $d$ apart. When can you use the expression:

$$V(\mathbf{r}) = \dfrac{1}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0}\dfrac{\mathbf{p}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}}{r^2}$$

1. This is an exact expression everywhere.
2. It's valid for large $r$
3. It's valid for small $r$
4. No idea...
