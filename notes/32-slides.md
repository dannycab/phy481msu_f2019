We defined the volume current density in terms of the differential, $\mathbf{J} \equiv \dfrac{d\mathbf{I}}{da_{\perp}}$.

When is it ok to determine the volume current density by taking the ratio of current to cross-sectional area?
$$\mathbf{J} \stackrel{?}{=} \dfrac{\mathbf{I}}{A}$$

1. Never
2. Always
3. $I$ is uniform
4. $I$ is uniform and $A$ is $\perp$ to $I$
5. None of these

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D

To find the magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ at P due to a current-carrying wire we use the Biot-Savart law,
$$\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})  = \dfrac{\mu_0}{4\pi}I\int \dfrac{d\mathbf{l}\times\hat{\mathfrak{R}}}{\mathfrak{R}^2}$$
In the figure, with $d\mathbf{l}$ shown, which purple vector best represents $\mathfrak{R}$?
