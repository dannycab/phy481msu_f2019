Are $\rho_b$ and $\sigma_b$ due to real charges?

1. Of course not! They are as fictitious as it gets!
2. Of course they are!  They are as real as it gets!
3. I have no idea


Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

If you put a polarizable material (a dielectric) in an external field $\mathbf{E}_e$, it polarizes, adding a new field, $\mathbf{E}_p$
(from the bound charges). These superpose, making a total field, $\mathbf{E}_T$.  What is the vector equation relating these three fields?

1. $\mathbf{E}_T + \mathbf{E}_e + \mathbf{E}_p = 0$
2. $\mathbf{E}_T = \mathbf{E}_e - \mathbf{E}_p$
3. $\mathbf{E}_T = \mathbf{E}_e + \mathbf{E}_p$
4. $\mathbf{E}_T = -\mathbf{E}_e + \mathbf{E}_p$
5. Something else
