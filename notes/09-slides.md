A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. What can we say about total electric flux through this surface $\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$?

1. It is $q/\varepsilon_0$.
2. We know what it is, but it is NOT $q/\varepsilon_0$.
3. Need more info/details to figure it out.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

A Gaussian surface which is *not* a sphere has a single charge (q) inside it, *not* at the center. There are more charges outside. Can we use Gauss's Law ($\oint_S \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{A}$) to find $|\mathbf{E}|$?

1. Yes
2. No
3. Maybe?

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

An electric dipole ($+q$ and $â€“q$, small distance $d$ apart) sits centered in a Gaussian sphere.

What can you say about the flux of $\mathbf{E}$ through the sphere, and $|\mathbf{E}|$ on the sphere?

1. Flux = 0, E = 0 everywhere on sphere surface
2. Flux = 0, E need not be zero *everywhere* on sphere
3. Flux is not zero, E = 0 everywhere on sphere
4. Flux is not zero, E need not be zero...

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Think about Q enclosed; what can we say about E though?

SLAC (Stanford Linear Accelerator Center) is where quarks (including the charm
quark), and the tauon (like a heavier electron) were discovered.

Note: Charged particles are accelerated inside a long metal cylindrical pipe, which is 2 miles long and has a radius R = 6 cm. All the air is pumped out of this pipe, known as the "beam line."

One afternoon, the beam line is struck by lightning, which gives it a uniform
surface charge density $+\sigma$. Does that affect the experiment?!

What is the infinitesimal area, $dA$, of a small patch on a cylindrical shell centered
on the z-axis?

1. $d\phi\,dz$
2. $s\,d\phi\,dz$
3. $s\,ds\,d\phi$
4. $ds\,dz$
5. Something else

Note: Correct answer B

<section data-markdown>

Which way does the electric field due to the positive charges resting on the beam line point for locations _outside the pipe_ far from the ends?

1. Roughly radially outward
2. Exactly radially outward
3. Roughly radially inward
4. Exactly radially inward
5. It varies too much to tell

Note: Correct answers A and B; talk about models and modeling

Which way does the electric field due to the positive charges resting on the beam line point for locations _inside the pipe_ far from the ends?

1. Exactly radially outward
2. Exactly radially inward
3. It varies too much to tell
4. Something else

Note: Correct answer D; it zero
