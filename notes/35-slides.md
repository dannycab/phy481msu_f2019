Consider the B-field a distance z from a current sheet (flowing in the +x-direction) in the z = 0 plane. The B-field has:

1. y-component only
2. z-component only
3. y and z-components
4. x, y, and z-components
5. Other

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

<img src="./images/solenoid_2D.png" align="right" style="width: 100px";/>
An infinite solenoid with surface current density $K$ is oriented along the $z$-axis. To use Ampere's Law, we need to argue what we think $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})$ depends on and which way it points.

For this solenoid, $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})=$

1. $B(z)\,\hat{z}$
2. $B(z)\,\hat{\phi}$
3. $B(s)\,\hat{z}$
4. $B(s)\,\hat{\phi}$
5. Something else?

An infinite solenoid with surface current density $K$ is oriented along the $z$-axis. Apply Ampere's Law to the rectangular imaginary loop in the $yz$ plane shown.  What does this tell you about $B_z$, the $z$-component of the B-field outside the solenoid?

1. $B_z$ is constant outside
2. $B_z$ is zero outside
3. $B_z$ is not constant outside
4. It tells you nothing about $B_z$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A

An infinite solenoid with surface current density $K$ is oriented along the $z$-axis. Apply Ampere's Law to the rectangular imaginary loop in the $yz$ plane shown. We can safely assume that $B(s\rightarrow\infty)=0$. What does this tell you about the B-field outside the solenoid?

1. $|\mathbf{B}|$ is a small non-zero constant outside
2. $|\mathbf{B}|$ is zero outside
3. $|\mathbf{B}|$ is not constant outside
4. We still don't know anything about $|\mathbf{B}|$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

What do we expect $\mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r})$ to look like for the infinite sheet of current shown below?

<img src="./images/current_sheet_coords.png" align="right" style="width: 300px";/>


1. $B(x)\hat{x}$
2. $B(z)\hat{x}$
3. $B(x)\hat{z}$
4. $B(z)\hat{z}$
5. Something else

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
