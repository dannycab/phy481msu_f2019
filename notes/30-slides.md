A negative charge ($-q$) is moving in the $+x$ direction when it encounters a region of constant magnetic field pointing in the $-y$ direction. Which is the direction of the initial net force on the charge?

1. $+y$
2. $-y$
3. $+z$
4. $-z$
5. ???

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
* Make sure to take into account the sign change

In the boundary condition for $E_{\perp}$, the difference across the boundary is $\dfrac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}.$ What does that $\sigma$ contain?

1. Just $\sigma_{f}$
2. Just $\sigma_{b}$
3. Both
4. Something else

Note: Correct answer C

What the sign of the dot product of the electric field and this normal vector above and below the boundary (i.e., $\mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{n}$)?

1. Above is positive; below is negative
2. Above is negative; below is negative
3. Above is negative; below is positive
4. Above is positive; below is positive


Note: Correct answer B

A + charged particle moving up (speed $v$) enters a region with uniform $\mathbf{B}$ (left) and uniform $\mathbf{E}$ (into page). What's the direction of $\mathbf{F}_{net}$ on the particle, at the instant it enters the region?

<img src="./images/charge_enters_EandB.png" align="right" style="width: 400px";/>


1. To the left
2. Into the page
3. Out of the page
4. No net force
5. Not enough information

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
* The forces point in opposite directions, but not sure of their size
