Consider a cylinder of radius $a$ and height $b$ that has it base at the origin and is aligned along the $z$-axis. The polarization of this cylinder is "baked in" and can be modeled using

$$\mathbf{P} = P_0 \left(\dfrac{z}{b}\right)\hat{z}.$$

Determine the total dipole moment of this cylinder:

1. $P_0 \pi a^2 b \hat{z}$
2. $\frac{1}{2} P_0 \pi a^2 b \hat{z}$
3. $P_0 2 \pi a b^2 \hat{z}$
4. $\frac{1}{2}P_0 \pi a b^2 \hat{z}$
5. Something else

Note:
* Correct answer: B take the integral

A VERY thin slab of thickness $d$ and area $A$ has volume charge density $\rho = Q / V$. Because it's so thin, we may think of it as a surface charge density $\sigma = Q / A$.

<img src="./images/thin_slab_polarization.png" align="center" style="width: 400px";/>


The relation between $\rho$ and $\sigma$ is:
1. $\sigma = \rho$
2. $\sigma = \rho d$
3. $\sigma = \rho/d$
4. $\sigma = V \rho$
5. $\sigma = \rho/V$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER:Â B
