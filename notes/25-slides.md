Which charge distributions below produce a potential that looks like $\frac{C}{r^2}$ when you are far away?

<img src="./images/multipole_charge_configs_1.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>

E) None of these, or more than one of these!

(For any which you did not select, how DO they behave at large r?)

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E (Both C and D)

In terms of the multipole expansion $V(r) = V(mono) + V(dip) + V(quad) + \dots$, the following charge distribution has the form:

<img src="./images/multipole_charge_configs_3.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>

1. $V(r) = V(mono) + V(dip) +\;$ higher order terms
2. $V(r) = V(dip) +\;$ higher order terms
3. $V(r) = V(dip)$
4. $V(r) =\;$ only higher order terms than dipole
5. No higher terms, $V(r) = 0$ for this one.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D

<img src="./images/multipole_charge_configs_4.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>


1. 1 and 3
2. 2 and 4
3. only 5
4. 1 and 5
5. Some other combo

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D

<section data-markdown>

Consider a single point charge at the origin. It will have ONLY a monopole contribution to the potential at a location $\mathbf{r} = \langle x,y,z\rangle$.

As we have seen, if we move the charge to another location (e.g., $\mathbf{r}' = \langle 0,0,d \rangle$), the distribution now has a dipole contribution to the potential at $\mathbf{r}$!

What the hell is going on here?

1. It's just how the math works out. Nothing has changed physically at $\mathbf{r}$.
2. There is something different about the field at $\mathbf{r}$ and the potential is showing us that.
3. I'm not sure how to resolve this problem.

A stationary point charge $+Q$ is near a block of polarization material (a linear dielectric).  The net electrostatic force on the block due to the point charge is:

1. attractive (to the left)
2. repulsive (to the right)
