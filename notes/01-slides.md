### Computational Homework problems

* We will be using Python on homework problems this semester.
* Installation instructions will appear on the Slack team site.
* Homework questions will take the form of [a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dannycab/phy481msu/blob/gh-pages/jupyter/HW1-GradientProblem.ipynb), which you can print to PDF and turn in.
* If you get stuck somewhere, post on Slack, so your classmates benefit from your question.
* Computational HW problems are turned in via Dropbox file requests. *Look for link at the top of each homework assignment and include your name in the filename!*

### Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge

As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.

* The homework is challenging but very important, don't short cut it
* Start your homework early and spend your time on understanding all of it
* Don't do it alone; form study groups
* Attend the help session, but start the homework first

## What do you think PHY 481 is about?

</section>

<section data-markdown>

### Electromagnetism is the foundational field theory of physics

Think about everything you already know about electromagnetism (it's a lot already!).

Work with a partner to map out the electromagnetism concepts that you know and how they are related to each other.
