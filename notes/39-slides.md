## What's on the final exam?

* A few true/false questions conceptual questions.
* Determine bound charge, $\mathbf{E}$, $\mathbf{D}$, $\mathbf{P}$ for some material with $\chi_e$, and explain where the bound charge is.
* Setup magnetic vector potential and field calculations. Compare the appraoches.
* Determine the $\mathbf{B}$ for some $\mathbf{J}$ using Ampere's Law.
* (BONUS) Determine bound currents, $\mathbf{B}$, and $\mathbf{H}$ for some material with a "simple" free current, and explain properties of the bound currents
