The eletric field between the shells is just that of a point charge. What is the electric potential difference between the outer shell ($r=b$) and the inner shell ($r=a$)?

1. $\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\dfrac{1}{b}-\dfrac{1}{a}\right)$
2. $\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\dfrac{1}{a}-\dfrac{1}{b}\right)$
3. $\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\dfrac{1}{b^2}-\dfrac{1}{a^2}\right)$
4. $\dfrac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0}\left(\dfrac{1}{a^2}-\dfrac{1}{b^2}\right)$
5. Something else?

Note: Correct Answer is B

You have two very large parallel plate capacitors, both with the same area and the same charge $Q$.
Capacitor \#1 has twice the gap of Capacitor \#2. Which has more stored potential energy?

1. \#1 has twice the stored energy
2. \#1 has more than twice
3. They both have the same
4. \#2 has twice the stored energy
5. \#2 has more than twice.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* E same; twice volume

A parallel plate capacitor is attached to a battery which maintains a constant voltage difference V between the capacitor plates.  While the battery is attached, the plates are pulled apart. The electrostatic energy stored in the capacitor

1. increases.
2. decreases.
3. stays constant.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Potential same; field is reduced; but shows up squared while d is increased, overall goes down

A region of space contains no charges. What can I say about $V$ in the interior?

1. Not much, there are lots of possibilities for $V(r)$ in there
2. $V(r)=0$ everywhere in the interior.
3. $V(r)=$constant everywhere in the interior

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
