## This Week!!!

* Homework 1 is already up (Due Wed. Sept. 7)
* Read (seriously do this!) Griffiths Ch 1.1-1.4 &amp; 2.1-2.2 [1]
* [Download Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

**Stay up-to-date by checking website, calendar, and discussion forum regularly.**

[1]: *I am assuming that Ch. 1 of Griffiths is mostly review.*

### Computational Homework problems

* We will be using Python on homework problems this semester.
* Installation instructions will appear on the Slack team site.
* Homework questions will take the form of [a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dannycab/phy481msu/blob/gh-pages/jupyter/HW1-GradientProblem.ipynb), which you can print to PDF and turn in.
* If you get stuck somewhere, post on Slack, so your classmates benefit from your question.
* Computational HW problems are turned in via Dropbox file requests. *Look for link at the top of each homework assignment and include your name in the filename!*

### Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge

As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.

<section data-markdown="">
### Advice from those who came before you

* Go to class every day and participate in the clicker questions/discussion
* The homework is challenging but very important, don't short cut it
* Start your homework early and spend your time on understanding all of it
* Don't do it alone; form study groups
* Attend the help session, but start the homework first

Thinking of what you want to get out of your college education and this course, which of the following is *most* important to you?

1. Acquiring information (facts, principles, concepts, procedures)
2. Learning how to use information and knowledge in new situations
3. Developing lifelong learning skills

</section>

<section data-markdown="">

All three of these goals are clearly important. However,  which of these three goals do you think you can do on our own (say, before class)?

1. Acquiring information (facts, principles, concepts, procedures)
2. Learning how to use information and knowledge in new situations
3. Developing lifelong learning skills

## What do you think PHY 481 is about?

<section data-markdown="">

### Electromagnetism is the foundational field theory of physics

Think about everything you already know about electromagnetism (it's a lot already!).

Work with a partner to map out the electromagnetism concepts that you know and how they are related to each other.
