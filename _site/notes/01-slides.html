## This Week!!!

* Homework 1 is already up (Due Fri. Sept. 6)
* Read (seriously do this!) Griffiths Ch 1.1-1.4 &amp; 2.1-2.2 [1]
* [Download Anaconda distribution of Python](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)

**Stay up-to-date by checking website, calendar, and Slack regularly.**

[1]: *I am assuming that Ch. 1 of Griffiths is mostly review.*

### Computational Homework problems

* We will be using Python on homework problems this semester.
* Installation instructions will appear on the Slack team site.
* Homework questions will take the form of [a Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/dannycab/phy481msu/blob/gh-pages/jupyter/HW1-GradientProblem.ipynb), which you can print to PDF and turn in.
* If you get stuck somewhere, post on Slack, so your classmates benefit from your question.
* Computational HW problems are turned in via Dropbox file requests. *Look for link at the top of each homework assignment and include your name in the filename!*

### Committment to an Inclusive Classroom

I am committed to creating an inclusive classroom.  If I can do anything to make the classroom a better learning environment for you, please let me know.

### Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting

One of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment. It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences. I will seek to keep information you share private.

However, I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct, relationship violence, or information about criminal activity with the University.

### Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge

As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.

### Advice from those who came before you

* Go to class every day and participate in the clicker questions/discussion
* The homework is challenging but very important, don't short cut it
* Start your homework early and spend your time on understanding all of it
* Don't do it alone; form study groups
* Attend the help session, but start the homework first
* Danny is never trying to trick you.

## What do you think PHY 481 is about?

</section>

<section data-markdown="">

### Electromagnetism is the foundational field theory of physics

Think about everything you already know about electromagnetism (it's a lot already!).

Work with a partner to map out the electromagnetism concepts that you know and how they are related to each other.
