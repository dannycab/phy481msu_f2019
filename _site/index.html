<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p>Physics 481, Electricity and Magnetism 1, is the first semester of our
two-semester sequence of junior-level classical electromagnetism. It
uses the tools of vector calculus for solving static and dynamic
properties of electromagnetic fields. The topics we will cover include
special cases of static charge distributions (electrostatics),
time-independent current distributions (magnetostatics), electric and
magnetic properties of matter (dielectrics and magnetic media), and,
(time permitting) initial coverage of fully time-dependent problems
(Maxwell’s equations). We have many learning goals in this course, which
include content and mathematical skill mastery, high level
problem-solving skills, physical sense-making, deepened conceptual
understanding, communication skills, and connection to other courses and
to the real world. <em>Required Prerequisites:</em> MTH 234 or MTH 254H or LB 220</p>

them all! There are <a href="http://goo.gl/78y9jw">other editions that might be less
expensive</a>, and they can be substituted. But
reading assignments will come from the 4th edition, which may have
some different content.</li>
  <li>An “iClicker”, available at the bookstore, will be used
every lecture.</li>

<h3 id="course-activities">Course Activities</h3>

<h4 id="readings">Readings</h4>

<p>Reading is an essential part of 481! Reading the text before class is
very important. Lecture is to clarify your understanding, to help you
make sense of the material. I will assume you have done the required
readings in advance! Griffiths is one of the best (and most readable)
texts I know of - it will make a huge difference if you spend the time
and effort to carefully read and follow the text. The
<a href="./calendar.html">calendar</a> has the details on reading assignments.</p>

<h4 id="class-meetings">Class Meetings</h4>

<p>Classroom Etiquette: Please silence your cell phones when entering the classroom.
I don’t mind you using them, but they can very distracting to your neighbors, so
use your judgement. I appreciate that you might have questions or comments about things in
class. If you and your neighbors are confused, just raise your hand and ask. If you are confused,
you are likely not the only one and it’s better to chat about it, then move on.
Questions in lecture are always good, and are strongly encouraged!</p>

<h4 id="homework">Homework</h4>

<p>There will be a homework due every Friday at the start of class. Late
homework can’t be accepted once solutions are posted - but, your lowest
score will be dropped. Homework is exceedingly important for developing
an understanding of the course material, not to mention building skills
in complex physical and mathematical problem solving. They will require
considerable time and personal effort this term!</p>

<p><em>I strongly encourage collaboration</em>, an essential skill in science and
engineering (and highly valued by employers!) Social interactions are
critical to scientists’ success – most good ideas grow out of
discussions with colleagues, and essentially all physicists work as part
of a group. Find partners and work on homework together. However, it is
also important that you OWN the material. I strongly suggest you start
homework by yourself (and that means really making an extended effort on
every problem). Then work with a group, and finally, finish up on your
own – write up your own work, in your own way. There will also be time
for peer discussion during classes – as you work together, try to help
your partners get over confusions, listen to them, ask each other
questions, critique, teach each other. You will learn a lot this way!
Note: While collaboration is the rule in technical work, evaluations of
individuals also play an important role. Exams will be done without help
from others. For all assignments, the work you turn in must in the end
be your own: in your own words, reflecting your own understanding. (If,
at any time, for any reason, you feel disadvantaged or isolated, contact
me and I can discretely try to help arrange study groups.)</p>

<p><strong>Computational Homework Problems:</strong> There will be <em>some use of computation in this course</em> on homework problems. I will encourage and support the use of Python (through <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebooks</a>). You do not need any computational experience for this course as you will learn some fundamentals early on and keep using them throughout the course. You are welcome to use any environment of your choosing (e.g., Octave/MATLAB, Mathematica, C++), but I will only provide support for Python. Python is in use across the sciences, but it is becoming much used in physics, so learning it will serve you well in
your future work. I suggest downloading the <a href="https://www.continuum.io/">Anaconda distribution of
Python</a> as it comes with all the packages you
will need to get up and running with Jupyter notebooks.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html">Installing Jupyter Notebooks</a></strong></p>

<h4 id="help-sessions-1">Help Sessions</h4>

<p>(Times will be listed at the top of the syllabus) Help sessions/office hours are to facilitate your learning. We encourage attendance - plan on working in small groups, our role will be as learning coaches. Both sessions are homework-centric, but we will not be explicitly telling anyone how to do the homework (how would that help you learn?) I strongly encourage you to start all problems on your own. If you come to help sessions “cold”, the value of homework to you will be greatly reduced.</p>

<h3 id="grading-and-exams">Grading and Exams</h3>

<p>Your course grade is largely determined by a combination of your
performance on exams and homework. There will be some extra credit for
in-class and online participation, which basically “unweights” the exams.</p>

<h4 id="clickers">Clickers</h4>

<p>Clickers are pure extra credit. They will add up to 5 points to your lowest midterm.
That is, take the total number of clicker question you answered (correct or not)
and divide by the total number asked in class. I will add up that fraction of points
up to 5 to your lowest midterm grade. Say you answer 90% of the clicker questions
and your lowest midterm grade is an 80. Then, after the extra credit that midterm
grade will be an 84.5% with the 4.5 point bonus from clickers (90% of 5 points).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://tinyurl.com/yxzbrcf6">Self register your clicker!</a></strong></p>

<h4 id="exams">Exams</h4>

<p>Exams will be held on the evenings as listed above. The reason for evenings
exams is to give you the time to work a regular 50-minute exam without the time pressure of
having less than 50 minutes to complete it. There are no makeups. You may not miss any exam except for
reasons beyond your control, approved by Prof. Caballero (usually a
confirmed medical problem with written documentation.) In the unusual
case of an (at most, single) excused absence from midterms, I’ll use an
average of your other exams. You may bring one side of a single sheet of
8.5 in. x 11 in. paper for each exam, with your own handwritten notes.
Calculators with scientific notation are allowed and sometimes needed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exam 1 Wed. Oct. 2 (7-9pm) in TBD</li>
  <li>Exam 2 Wed. Nov. 6 (7-9pm) in TBD</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="exam-re-writes">Exam Re-writes</h5>

<p>Exams can be a stressful situtation and, sometimes, what you know doesn’t really come across with
the first attempt at the exam.</p>

<p>For both Exam 1 and 2, you will be allowed to rework the exams to earn up to 50% of the credit that
you weren’t awarded the first time you took it. To earn this credit, you will need to rework the exam
and turn in a page that addresses what you did incorrectly on the exam and
how you fixed up that understanding.</p>

<p>You are welcome to work the exam with your classmates, but the work you turn in
must be your own.</p>

<h3 id="what-we-cover-and-why">What we cover, and why:</h3>

<p>Physics 481 covers topics in electricity and magnetism (E&amp;M). It is the
first semester of your second course in E&amp;M (Physics 184/294H was the
first), but the first course in a true field theory. Classical
electrodynamics (in the form of Maxwell’s equations) is one of the most
successful physical theories that we presently have. While it is a
classical theory (no quantum mechanical Uncertainty Principle here), its
conflicts with Newtonian mechanics motivated Einstein’s development of
Special Relativity. Thus, classical E&amp;M is the first relativistically
correct field theory. Also, Maxwell’s unification of electricity with
magnetism (at first viewed as separate phenomena) was the first and
grandest example of unification of forces in physics.</p>

<p>For these reasons, along with the sheer mathematical elegance and
completeness of the theory, and its extraordinary (uncanny!) agreement
with experiment, electromagnetism is an inspiration for the creation of
other physical theories including quantum mechanics and quantum field
theory, and indeed much of contemporary physics. Further, classical E&amp;M
is at the root of a huge number of practical applications. Most of the
phenomena of everyday experience, sights, smells, texture, etc. arise
from a balance of electromagnetic interactions and quantum mechanics.
E&amp;M is essential in understanding the physics behind electric power
generation, electronics, optics, communications, (and on, and on!) We
view the universe around us primarily via the electromagnetic radiation.
Clearly, to understand the physical world, we need to understand
electricity and magnetism!</p>

<h3 id="comments-on-preparation">Comments on preparation:</h3>

<p>Physics 481 covers material you have seen before (Many of the topics
stem from PHY 184/294H material) but at a higher level of conceptual and
mathematical sophistication.</p>

<p>Therefore you should expect:</p>

<ul>
  <li>a large amount of material covered quickly.</li>
  <li>no recitations, and few examples covered in lecture. Most homework
problems are not similar to examples from class.</li>
  <li>long, hard homework problems that usually cannot be completed by one
individual alone.</li>
  <li>challenging exams.</li>
</ul>

<p>Physics 481 is a challenging, upper‐division physics course. Unlike more
introductory courses, you are fully responsible for your own learning.
In particular, you control the pace of the course by asking questions in
class. I tend to speak quickly, and questions are important to slow down
the lecture. This means that if you don’t understand something, it is
your responsibility to ask questions. Attending class and the homework
help sessions gives you an opportunity to ask questions. I am here to
help you as much as possible, but I need your questions to know what you
don’t understand.</p>

<p>Physics 481 covers some of the most important physics and mathematical
methods in the field. Your reward for the hard work and effort will be
learning important and elegant material that you will use over and over
as a physics major. Here is what I have experienced, and heard from
other faculty teaching upper division physics in the past:</p>

<ul>
  <li>most students reported spending a minimum of 10 hours per week on the
homework</li>
  <li>students who didn’t attend the homework help sessions
often did poorly in the class.</li>
  <li>students reported learning a tremendous amount in this class.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The course topics that we will cover in Physics 481 are among the
greatest intellectual achievements of humans. Don’t be surprised if you
have to think hard and work hard to master the material.</strong></p>

<h3 id="committment-to-an-inclusive-classroom">Committment to an Inclusive Classroom</h3>

<p>I am committed to creating an inclusive classroom - one where you and your classmates
feel comfortable, intellectually challenged, and able to speak up about your ideas
and experiences. This means that our classroom, our virtual environments, and our interactions
need to be as inclusive as possible. Mutual respect, civility, and the ability to listen
and observe others are central to creating a classroom that is inclusive. I will strive to
do this and I ask that you do the same. If I can do anything to make the classroom a better
learning environment for you, please let me know.</p>

<p><strong>If you observe or experience behaviors that violate our committment to inclusivity,
please let me know as soon as possible.</strong></p>

<p>If I violate this principle, please let me know
or please tell the undergraduate department chair,
Stuart Tessmer (<a href="mailto:tessmer@pa.msu.edu">tessmer@pa.msu.edu</a>), who I have informed to tell me about any such incidents
without conveying student information to me.</p>

<h3 id="confidentiality-and-mandatory-reporting">Confidentiality and Mandatory Reporting</h3>

<p>College students often experience issues that may interfere with academic success such as academic stress, sleep problems, juggling responsibiities, life events, relationship concerns, or feelings of anxiety, hopelessness, or depression.
As your instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment and to support you through these situations and experiences.
I also have a mandatory reporting responsibility related to my role as a University employee.
It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom
discussions, in written work, and in one-on-one meetings.
I will seek to keep information you share private to the greatest extent possible.
However, under Title IX, I am required to share information regarding sexual misconduct, relationship violence, or information
about criminal activity on MSU’s campus with the University including the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE).</p>

<p><strong>Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting MSU Counseling and Psychiatric Service (CAPS) (caps.msu.edu, 517-355-8270), MSU’s 24-hour Sexual Assault Crisis Line (endrape.msu.edu, 517-372-6666), or Olin Health Center (olin.msu.edu, 517-884-6546).</strong></p>

<h3 id="spartan-code-of-honor-academic-pledge">Spartan Code of Honor Academic Pledge</h3>

<p>As a Spartan, I will strive to uphold values of the highest ethical standard. I will practice honesty in my work, foster honesty in my peers, and take pride in knowing that honor is worth more than grades. I will carry these values beyond my time as a student at Michigan State University, continuing the endeavor to build personal integrity in all that I do.</p>

<h3 id="handling-emergency-situations">Handling Emergency Situations</h3>

<p><em>In the event of an emergency arising within the classroom, Prof. Caballero will notify you of what actions that may be required to ensure your safety. It is the responsibility of each student to understand the evacuation, “shelter-in-place,” and “secure-in-place” guidelines posted in each facility and to act in a safe manner. You are allowed to maintain cellular devices in a silent mode during this course, in order to receive emergency SMS text, phone or email messages distributed by the university. When anyone receives such a notification or observes an emergency situation, they should immediately bring it to the attention of Prof. Caballero in a way that causes the least disruption. If an evacuation is ordered, please ensure that you do it in a safe manner and facilitate those around you that may not otherwise be able to safely leave. When these orders are given, you do have the right as a member of this community to follow that order. Also, if a shelter-in-place or secure-in-place is ordered, please seek areas of refuge that are safe depending on the emergency encountered and provide assistance if it is advisable to do so.</em></p>
